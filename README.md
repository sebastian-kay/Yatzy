## Jatsi

This is a Yatzy/Yahtzee game that runs on Node.js backend and Vue.js frontend.

You can test the game running in Heroku:
https://jatsi.herokuapp.com

## Why does this repository exist?

Developed this version of the classic game just for fun and self-learning. All the logic and data is in backend. Frontend is more or less just displaying the results and triggering events to backend.

## Installation

You must have Node.js installed. Should work with Node.js version 6.x.x or later. Developed and tested with version 6.11.0 LTS. Clone this repository. Install required modules (just express and body-parser). By default the UI can be accessed from port 8080. You can define port with process.env.PORT. I have tested UI to work fine with latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge and Opera.
